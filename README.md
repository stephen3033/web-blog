# Personal Blog for all personal projects

- this website is using bun, vite, and react for a lightweight development experience
- NOTE: this is not the most lightweight experience possible, it is however lighter than I have done before with using NPM and Create React App
- for this first revision, this website is going to be static and a basic web page to display blog posts
- in the future, this is going to be designed as a fullstack application to make it easier to write blog posts
- this blog is also going to link to all personal projects and applications under current development
